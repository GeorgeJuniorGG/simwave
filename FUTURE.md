Next steps:
* Implement 3D + density
* add sources in the equation
* generalize data classes into one superclass
* generalize wave propagators into one superclass
* simple absorbing layer (domain extension, numpy.pad -> "edge") - see SeismicMesh as example
* put parameters into macros for better performance
* python/CUDA integration
* create VTK files
* 4th order in space discretization
* paper
* propagators
  * acoustic
