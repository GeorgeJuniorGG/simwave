Next steps:
* Implement 3D + density        (doing)
* add sources in the equation   (doing)
* generalize data classes into one superclass    (done)
* generalize wave propagators into one superclass  
* simple absorbing layer (domain extension, numpy.pad -> "edge") - see SeismicMesh as example
* put parameters into macros for better performance
* python/CUDA integration
* create VTK files
* spatial order discretization: 2nd, 5th or 6th
* unit tests
* install via pip
* documentation
* paper
* propagators
  * acoustic ...
* Classes, interfaces etc
